I like money i got bands in my pocket
if i back out the strap youll fly like a rocket
rounds in the city im the the plug like a socket
i stay on my hustle you really cant knock it

pinky ring on my finger too icey
got a check why you think im looking pricey
driving round in my whip no ice cream
really getting money being rich aint a pipe dream
